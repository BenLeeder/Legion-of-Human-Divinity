  <h3 style="margin-top: 2em;">Our Mission</h3>
  <p style="max-width: 700px; margin: auto; font-size: 1.1em;">
    Legion of Human Divinity exists to awaken the divine potential within all people through spiritual unity, 
    communal support, and conscious living. Guided by The Universal Consciousness (TUC), we are devoted to 
    advancing the human experience by creating pathways to reduce the burden of material dependency and lessen 
    the cost of everyday living. We believe that by uplifting one another, we honor the sacred presence of divinity 
    within us all.
